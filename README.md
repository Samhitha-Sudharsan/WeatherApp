# WeatherApp
The app is a simple weather application built using Node.js and the Express framework. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for retrieving the current weather data for a specified city. The app uses the Express framework to handle HTTP requests and the axios module to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. The app then extracts the relevant data from the API response and sends it back to the user in a formatted response.
